"had her for 101 and liked her, everything you do counts for grade in that class making it easy, online assignments are easy, very nice and helpful, come to class, do homework, it\'s hard not to do well in the class, best span prof I\'ve ever had",4.8,"friendly, helpful, easy grading, engaging"
"Great guy! Very disorganized at times, but his humor tries to make up for it. Gives GREAT study reviews for exams. Highly recommended.",3.9,"Great guy, disorganized, humor, great study reviews, highly recommended"

"Mrs. Phillips was not the best at getting back to you on time via email, but if you stayed after class to talk, she is more than willing to hear you out and fix any problems your having.",4.1,"unresponsive, helpful, accommodating"
Lectures are always interesting and well organized. Likes class participation but it doesn\'t guarantee you a good grade. Tough marker but her suggestions will make you a better writer. Be prepared to put a lot of work into assignments if you want to do well. Essay/exam topics come directly from class discussion so read the books and go to class.,3.1,"interesting, well-organized, tough marker, suggestions for improvement, class participation, requires effort, class discussion-based, book reading important"

"I loved evolution with Bro. Zenger. The subject matter itself is pretty easy. Just read from the text book, and discuss in class. There is a very large paper you have to write, which is a lot of work, but you get to choose what you write about, so that helps. Bro. Zenger is a great teacher and he cares deeply about his students.",4.1,"loved, easy, large paper, great teacher, cares deeply"
She\'s pretty cool. I learned a lot and she\'s really nice and helpful.,4.9,"cool, learned a lot, nice, helpful"
"Coleman is challenging. Students basically argue for a whole 2.40 hours. Other will say that he is not worth putting up with. He does come off as belittling, so if you are up for a challenge, take this class. If not, avoid it because you will be put on the spot. Other than that, he has a lot to say and numerous interesting, heart wrenching stories.",2.9,"challenging, belittling, interesting, heart-wrenching"
"This prof talks to you like you are a child of 7, not an adult of 19 -20. It\'s a joke. Haven\'t been in something so juvenile since 2nd grade. Insulting. Didn\'t learn a thing from her. Good thing students do her job for her. She doesn\'t seem to respect students enough to talk to them as adults. I don\'t pay thousands to be treated like I\'m 7. Avoid.",3.6,"insulting, juvenile, disrespectful, avoid"

Dr. K is a great professor. If you have the opportunity you should take him. Keeps the class engaged and respects all of his students. He teaches you life lessons I don\'t think you\'ll find in any other class at DePaul.,4.8,"great professor, engaging, respectful, teaches life lessons"
Just talk for the time he wants you to and do your outlines and speaker critiques and youll be good! Really easy and laid back. Watched a lot of movies,3.2,"easy, laid back, movies"

James is a fantastic teacher. If you bomb the midterm or final it will not kill you. The inquizzitives he gives are impossible to fail and are an easy A. He is heavy on reading.

"Pratt should never, ever have become a professor.",4.0,NA
"All in all, a great professor. While her tests can get rather hard, she gives bonus points to make up for it, and even once gave us 25 bonus points on a 100 point test. There are only three tests and a final. If you work hard and put in the effort, you will easily get an A. She is willing to help you. The only way to fail her class is to be lazy.",2.5,"great professor, hard tests, bonus points, willing to help, high expectations, motivates students, generous with grading, fair grading, high standards, supportive, encourages hard work, no room for laziness"

"Hard grader, but her comments are very helpful. Very friendly and approachable. Lots of reading and critical analysis of the text.

"I thought to myself upon entering her class.....wow, she is a die-hard liberal, and I am NOT going to be happy. However, I would recommend her to everyone considering Poli Sci. She will open your mind to things you previously have never thought of. I can truly say she is brilliant; a little scattered, which hurt the class....but brilliant.",3.6,"brilliant, open-minded, passionate, knowledgeable, recommended"
"Where do I begin? Dr. Waterhouse has to be THE BEST professor I\'ve had at CalU, thus far! She\'s extremely kind and caring, not mention helpful. I had her for Wednesday night class and she actually made me WANT to go to class. I definitely recommend her to everyone. :)",4.4,"kind, caring, helpful, best professor, recommend"
She takes off points for simple arithmetic. On our last test she made us memorize ten problems that were all fairly similar. She did so because she thinks we should compete with her calculus class. She rarely teaches from the actual book and instead teaches from her own notes which are not available unless you copy them.,2.8,"strict, competitive, unorthodox, unhelpful"
"Very hard, Don\'t take.",2.7,"hard, don't take"

"Very nice man. Fair grader, responsive to questions. At first I thought the class would be boring, but it was interesting. Do the study guides!",3.9,"friendly, fair grader, responsive, interesting"
Hyde is by far the best professor I\'ve had at SPSCC. His criminology class was extremely interesting and I learned a lot from him! The lectures could sometimes be dull but he would tend to tell personal stories to liven things up. The homework load was minimal and we hardly ever used the book in class.

Haynie\'s class is amazing. We have some deep discussions sometimes and it is interesting. We also missed alot of classes and got out early often. Reading material is very interesting too. This was an awesome class. Recommended A+,4.7,"amazing, deep discussions, interesting, missed classes, got out early, reading material, awesome, recommended, A+"
Chem 103 was a little tough. His notes are sporadic and random. He goes out of the book so don\'t depend on your notes. He isn\'t very clear about most things but he does love what he does! The tests ask a lot of random minor things you barely cover so know everything. He has a major grading curve so that is nice but the tests are pretty tricky.,3.0,"tough, sporadic, random, unclear, loves teaching, major grading curve, tricky"

Super easy. show up to class. take some notes. stay for the films. only 2 tests (midterm and final) both are open note and open book. and one extremely easy paper. no reason for anyone to get lower than a B.

"Extremely difficult, but doable. Be prepared to study at least a couple of hours everyother night to stay on top of the subject.

When I read that Dr. Douglas was a good adviser it shocked me. Any time you visit it seems like he is inconvenienced. Along with that he couldn\'t even explain how to add a minor/certificate.

This is by far one of my worst math teachers in my entire life. Does not explain many things on the tests. Loncapa is much more difficult than it should be since it does not give you the right answer when trying to teach the math to yourself. I highly recommend not taking this class with him.

Very difficult class. Robert Coleman enjoys putting students on the spotlight and will keep pressuring you to speak even when you have no idea what to say.

Attend her class or you won\'t know what you\'re doing. The notes she posted online (posted a day before the exam at that matter) does nothing to assist your studies.
