"Never noticed him goad or insult anyone. Very kind. Ultra-liberal. Comments on papers are helpful, but not exhaustive. His lectures are slow but informative because he pauses to think about what he is going to say. Friendly in and outside of class.",3.5,"kind, ultra-liberal, helpful, informative, friendly"

"fairly cool teacher, but really into ecology. Be warned, the ecology is mindless busywork, today we counted how many mealworms were being bred in a mound by hand-2300. But she is by far the best and easiest of all the lab teachers",4.3,"cool, into ecology, mindless busywork, best, easiest"
Coach respects everyone\'s opinion. He encourages everyone to share their feelings. Love this class. I\'ll miss him.,4.3,"respectful, encouraging, caring"
She\'s a great teacher. She\'s very nice and funny. The books are easy reads and its very easy to get an A in the class. The essays are not bad. I recommend her for anyone taking any of her english classes.,4.7,"great, nice, funny, easy, recommend"

"Mr. Hu is a very nice guy, but he\'s also one of the most difficult math professors I\'ve ever had. I struggled to earn a C, but Hu is very well organized and you can learn a lot from his lectures.

She\'s a very nice lady and she\'s a great teacher.,4.8,"nice, great"
i regret enrolling in this course. *not happy*,2.2,NA
"Re: Class size. Do you seriously think it is the prof\'s fault that the class is so large? And for those of you who complain about his by the book style, would prefer he not touch on the books in class, but test you on it anyways? Anyways, this guy is a great prof.",3.7,great prof
its hard to understand an instructor who dont speak english,2.5,NA
"Professor Young is amazing! I have always had a hard time with algebra, I made a C in pre algebra even! I dropped college algebra three times before finding professor Young. He speaks math to where I can actually understand it. Couldn\'t find a better math teacher!",4.6,"amazing, speaks math well, understandable, best math teacher"
"Has been teaching English for 30 years. Loves lit; constantly talks about the ""beauty"" of a passage--or how ""this one line is worth studying the entire semester for--seriously."" Compared to other lit courses, the reading is fairly light--about 2-4 chapters per class. But my first paper grade was a vague B+/A-, which you should expect a lot of.",4.0,"experienced, passionate, enthusiastic, insightful, light workload, high expectations"
this is the biggest farce of a class that i have ever seen. and how can it even be considered a class if it\'s always cancelled? nice prof. but not a good one.,2.5,"farce, cancelled, nice prof"
"AMAZING prof. One of the best I have had in a long time. Tries to connect everything to the students and encourages discussions in class. .

"If you have to take this class and dont want to have to study too much. Carter is the guy to take. If you want to really learn something though he\'s not the guy.

"Great lecturer, clearly enthusiastic about film and her passion rubs off on students. Very clear, very helpful, all in all awesome prof!",3.7,"Great lecturer, enthusiastic, passionate, clear, helpful, awesome prof"
"I know he seems intimidating. It\'s easy. The key to this class is to do the work. People don\'t come to class prepare (ie do the readings) and then expect him to teach all the basics. It\'s simple. Do the work before class, challenge yourself by extra problems, ask the tutor if you have questions and you\'ll do fine.",3.2,"intimidating, easy, do the work, prepare, challenge, extra problems, ask the tutor, fine"
"Taken a million of his classes, and would recommend each one. Love him!",4.9,"friendly, knowledgeable, recommended"

"Professor Saunders, is very clear on what you should expect for a lit class. If you have questions ask her, If you don\'t understand why you got a certain grade, she will answer it, and give decent to good feed back.

"It would be nice if she wouldn\'t be so relentless about the documents and the grammar. I understand your intent, but this is a typing class... Not an English class...

I hope you have a teacher just like you, maybe then you\'ll change.",3.6,"relentless, grammar, typing class, English class, teacher"
Wouldnt take this class ever again,4.3,NA
"She is a bad teacher. The class consists of 2 tests and a paper. On the tests she asks things like, ""From the coursepack, the article __ was published in what year?"" Who cares what year it\'s published?! And she is incredibly boring. I seriously think she wrote all the nice comments about herself below this one. No one can actually think she\'s good.",3.5,"bad teacher, boring, uninteresting, irrelevant questions"
excellent,3.9,excellent
"My worst grade for a course so far in university. I think it\'s the annoying overuse of textbook material that makes the class hard. It\'s very frustrating when all of your marks come from exams (based only on textbook material), and there are no assignments or lab work. His slideshow notes are terrible - they contain only words and no explanations.",2.7,"annoying, frustrating, terrible"
"not fun. not recommended. at all. you can take the same class, learn just as much, and not have a nightmare semester thanks to dinero. not helpful. not understanding. gives no slack. class is interesting, but he is a ****.",1.6,NA
"This professor only lectures about why students should be good people and be classy. Come time for our midterm, everyone asked what the test was going to be on because no material was covered or understandable in class. There wasn\'t even enough time to take her midterm because she talked the majority of the time about her day. Never again.",2.3,"lectures, good people, classy, midterm, material, understandable, time management"
"Beware of Dr Fernando as a professor or advisor. He does not teach to broad learning styles in students. It can be a serious problem for someone who needs to understand plant science taught by him. He relies on textbooks. When answering questions, he was more intolerant and unhelpful than any other teacher I have ever had.",3.1,"unhelpful, intolerant, relies on textbooks, not accommodating to different learning styles"
Professor Strong is an awesome teacher. He teaches the science and relates it all to real life. If you stick with him he eases up towards the end of the semester. He is knowledgeable and wise. He is always willing to stay after class to help and even held a study group on a Saturday morning before finals. He\'s the best! Take him if you can.,3.5,"knowledgeable, wise, awesome, best, helpful"
class is fun and he is not a bad professor...reallly likes to talk to much though,4.2,"fun, not bad professor, talks too much"

"If you\'re a psyc major at UTT, you will have to take Dr. Schrieber for several classes. He is a very knowledgable professor, but has no pedagogic ability whatsoever. Granted you will make an A guaranteed, but you won\'t learn anything at all. Dr. Schriber may be a cool guy, but his classes are a total waste of time and money.",2.7,"knowledgeable, guaranteed A, cool, waste of time and money"
This class was real easy. The guys knows what he is talking about.,4.4,"easy, knowledgeable"
She is a tough grader an the fact that the paper has such a significant effect on your grade doesn\'t make sense since the paper is on anything you want to write about. \r On the up side she does make the topic interesting and she really enjoys what she teaches. Also she is willing to work with you.,3.9,"tough grader, significant effect on grade, interesting topic, enjoys teaching, willing to work with students"

He is thee hotterst teacher in the face of the whole world. He love his job and that make it easier for the students to learned. I can not imagine learning much from somoeone eilse then him.

"She is wonderfully helpful. The book is def needed, although it isnt used all the time. She incorporates many outside resources into exams. She is confusing sometimes; incredibly nice and helpful.

I took the web class. The class itself was very easy with online exams you can take as many times as you need. The only thing I hated was the final. Four essay questions at 250 words each and about 50 multiple choice. All based on previous test & paper. WAY too much to remember for a final.,4.8,"easy, online exams, hated, final, essay questions, multiple choice, too much, remember, NA"

"She knows her sh*t. A freaking math genious to boot. She really wants you to understand the material, and is always very helpful, and is more than willing to reexplain for clairity. She also realizes that the material is extremely complicated, so she makes the tests easy. :)",4.6,"knowledgeable, helpful, understanding, approachable"
I am in his last class before he retires. BE THANKFUL YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HIM AS YOUR TEACHER!!! He doesn\'t stay focused. He goes off on things not related to this class.

He uses wrong solutions in the lab saying they work the same yet give different results.,2.6,"retires, unfocused, off-topic, overly in depth, lies, wrong solutions"

Most in my class also got an A.",1.8,"hardworking, helpful, nice, effective, demanding"
Amazing teacher if you are willing to put in the time. He goes out of his way to make sure every student understands. Can be extremely creative in his teaching methods.

"Dr. E is a super nice guy, but I don\'t think he should be teaching lower level chem. He just assumes that we already know what he\'s talking about, so he doesn\'t explain anything.

"Cynthia expects you to already know the material in class before learning it,and when you ask questions she makes you feel stupid and says you should already know the answer and tells you to ask class members for the answer. very scatterbrained jumps from topic to topic. i learned absolutely nothing from her, i learned more by teaching myself.",4.0,"demanding, unhelpful, scatterbrained, ineffective"

Rick is such a great prof. I feel like I can just sit back and learn in his class!

Great guy. He is not like any other professor because he doesn\'t stick to a schedule for a course.

This is one of the worst classes I have ever taken. His tests are ridiculously difficult.

All I can say is Don\'t take this class. If you want to learn self defense go to a real school not some 8 week class where you are going to be abused physically and verbally.
