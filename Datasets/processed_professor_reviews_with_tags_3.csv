"Don\'t buy the book, he never uses it. If you like listening about his son, great because that\'s all you are going to do! It was an easy class but I didn\'t care for him because all he talks about is himself and not what\'s on the test. It\'s an easy class though.",3.8,"self-centered, irrelevant anecdotes, easy class"
I really hate his teaching style... he goes on and on and doesn\'t explain things well. Plus he wrote his own textbook... and you must read it because he\'s not great at teaching... retire already..,4.3,"hate, goes on and on, doesn't explain well, wrote own textbook, must read, not great at teaching, retire"

"I took him for both my 310 and 410. He\'s good, the best professor in SHA. Just go to every class and take notes. He told you what the problem will be on the exam before hand.

"I bet the previous post is from the girl who had already failed his class once and probably failed again. He was without question the best math teacher I have ever had at any level.

Students took calls if needed also.",4.6,"responsible, best math teacher, dedicated, few phone calls"
"The worst experience I have ever encountered with a professor. He NEVER answered my emails, or questions.

She was an amazing professor who really took time to listen to her students.

She great! I love her. She tough yet hepfull!!!!,4.9,"friendly, tough, helpful"
"She\'s a little outdated for an education teacher. Someone who was in the school system while dinosaurs were still on the earth should NOT still be teaching classes on education, in my humble opinion.

"Dr. Horn has a very unique teaching style. In short he doesn\'t really teach.

horrible teacher. He uses his personal opinion over the text information on tests. Don\'t buy the book you won\'t need it. attendance isnt mandatory so don\'t bother going.
