"Homework isn\'t mandatory, which is nice. Does a lot of examples on the board, but makes a lot of mistakes. Is NOT a fair grader, taking off more points than necessary for small mistakes (especially considering how often he messes up on the board). Overall, he is a nice guy, though, and i would definitely take a class with him again.",4.1,"nice, examples, mistakes, fair grader, small mistakes, messes up, nice guy"

"Great guy, really cares about his students. Stick to the Biochem notes and you\'ll do fine. He curves so most people can pass with a C, but if you cant get at least a B- in his classes, you need to become a Business major. Attend lecture because he often cuts lots of material to study.",2.0,"caring, knowledgeable, helpful, curves grades, engaging, emphasizes lecture attendance"
"Not a bad teacher, just a tough subject although he can be hard to understand sometimes. You have to pay attention because he does not really review past lectures. If you miss classes chances are you wont do so well on the tests.",3.1,"tough, hard to understand, does not review, strict"

"His lectures usually have nothing to do with the lesson nor do they relate to the textbook Tests are all or nothing, meaning you either get 25 points in a question or 0 points. One little mistake in code and you lose all points (I wish I was exaggerating). Your best bet is to hope his old tests make sense.",3.2,"- Unrelated lectures,

"Prof Phillips\'s class was pretty enjoyable to take. I had been dreading taking bio but she has made it an easy experience. I was in a blended class that met once a week for lab. So for our class she was a little easier with the deadlines, but she\'s really understanding. If you\'re not interested in doing a semester project, don\'t take the class.",4.1,"enjoyable, easy experience, understanding, not interested, semester project"
This is the worst professor I\'ve had in my entire college career. I am an A student but I\'ve never been so frustrated. He drones for 3 hours about nothing but expects us you to know everything (plus stuff he hasn\'t covered come test time). He is not helpful and is arrogant! The study guides for tests are also over 100 pages with uncovered material!,3.9,"worst, frustrated, drones, expects, arrogant, unhelpful, over 100 pages, uncovered material"
"Dr. Davis is nice enough, but she is unbelievably hard. Was pretty interested in Political Science prior to taking her class, but now, will never take another one. Really tough papers with very vague prompts. Avoid her FYS 102 at all costs.",3.5,"strict, tough, vague prompts, avoid"
Worst class I have ever taken at UNC. This is a pre req for med schools and dental schools and most people in there are taking this class for that reason. This class is extremely tough and they do not try to help or explain things well at all. If you can take it somewhere else do it! I made the mistake of taking it here and now have to repeat it.,3.0,"worst, tough, not helpful, repeat"
Course is listed as online but should be shown as hybrid because you have to go to campus for tests. Have to email her multiple times before receiving a response and by that point it is too late. Uninterested in helping students in anyway. Horrible at clarifying what needs to be done. If you take her course you will regret it.,3.0,"unresponsive, unhelpful, unorganized, regretful"

"As baller as they come. Laid back but always willing to help out the lost and confused.

I had her for College Success. She is a great professor. She cares about her students. She does give a lot of busy work but it is not hard. We had to give 3 or 4 presentations during the semester.

Rachel\'s class was transformative. She is real. She genuinely cares about her students and there are no topics off limits from her class discussions.

"Now, to finish my review from below...I sat in the back of the class room all semester and hardly ever spoke. I think it took him most of the semester to remember my name.

I am the worst student in the world when it comes to math but he really keeps it simple. He gives plenty of examples in class and helps you understand the material.

"By far the worst teacher I have ever had. He is probably one of the most brilliant at Wayne State, but does not know how to teach by any means.

This professor is TOUGH. This is no easy ride and you should be thankful for that. You go to school to LEARN and not to just receive a degree. We pay more for our degrees than Rutgers students so we should expect to work for it. You work for it in this class. Love this professor.,3.0,"TOUGH, LEARN, WORK, Love"
She\'s really confusing at times so try to pay attention she is VERY serious about only talking in spanish from the minute you walk in the door.

"I did not understand her grading. Her lectures were poor, so you learned nothing other than what\'s due. A few office hours, so pray god to catch her.

This teacher is smart and fun if a bit wacky. He\'ll keep you guessing which will keep you interested - something good for a subject that can be a bit dull.

Don\'t listen to the bad reviews. Tudor really is the best teacher for Cells/Genetics. He is a very nice guy and very approachable which MANY of the bio professors at SJU aren\'t.

Beneski is very monotone and the lectures are dry. You need to go to class and take good notes because he goes into much more detail just off the top of his head.
