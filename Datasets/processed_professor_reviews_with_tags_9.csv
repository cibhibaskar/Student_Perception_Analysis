"The best professor I have had at York. He is so passionate about his work and extremely engaging. One of the only classes that I found time flew by during lectures.

"Very hypocritical. Teaches a class that should teach open mindedness but yet he is the most close minded person I have met. In his class there are two types of OPINIONS, his and the wrong ones. I would say the class is 90% online yet he is incompetent at helping/working with Moodle (the class\' website) himself. If you get him good luck.",1.6,"hypocritical, close minded, incompetent"
"The most time consuming class I\'ve ever taken. She is a tough grader but very detailed in her feedback. Online class had 7 total papers and endless online discussions.

"I loved his lecture style! It\'s frustrating when professors put up slides and expect you to just copy them down while talking fast.
