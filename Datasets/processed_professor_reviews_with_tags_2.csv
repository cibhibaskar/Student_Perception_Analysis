the proverbial one trick pony. typical never built a thing professor.ask to see his work. its laughable...,2.7,"one trick pony, never built a thing, laughable"
"Not the worst teacher, but certainly not the best. She is lazy in class and skips a lot steps which can lead to confusion. Might be a language barrier thing but she almost seems condescending when answering in-class questions. Her teaching style is to show you the process rather than the theory, which is not always ideal. Not a teacher for everyone",4.1,"lazy, skips steps, confusion, condescending, process-oriented"
Fitzpatrick is a total valley girl that sounds like she has a 3rd grade education. Class was really boring. Watched old movies from the 70\'s/80\'s that didn\'t teach us anything.

"Unfortunately she is just not qualified to teach about the Middle East. Rather than providing students with knowledge they need to engage and combat the paradigms in question, she attempts to train them as activists. Perhaps this is because her knowledge base is in English Literature, and is seriously lacking in history and politics of the region.",4.0,"unqualified, lacking knowledge, English Literature, lacking history, lacking politics"

Radhika is by far one of the worst teacher I have ever had. You MUST attend class everyday to take the participation assignments that are REALLY hard!

Very unclear lecturer. He messes up the dates often and his lack of clarity makes it extremely hard to understand what he is lecturing about.

She did not explain her assignments very well and when did not clarify when we needed to turn things in. She was extremely disorganized as well.

Nice guy though.",2.4,"blow off class, few grades, few assignments, outrageous midterm, low average curve, only teacher, nice guy"
She was the best history teacher I\'ve ever had in my life! She was fair in her grading and even gave us extra credit multiple times.

I really enjoyed this class. I took the online version as long as you do the work and really try you can get an A. There is a lot of homework but it is pretty easy you just have to follow the book.

"This professor is quite possibly the best I\'ve taken so far. English is definitely his 2nd lang. but his teaching is better than all the other teachers i have taken so far. He grades extremely fair. And if your motivated, there is no reason why you won\'t get an A in his class. He is not confusing and easy to understand",4.0,"motivated, fair, easy to understand, best"
"She tends to be unorganized, messy with her handwriting and unattentive to the blackboard chat when we, as the students, try to correct her. It was to the point where I actually had to not go to her online class anymore because all she did was confuse me more than she taught me. All in all, I got an A by self-study and teaching.",3.5,"unorganized, messy handwriting, unattentive, confusing"
i won\'t suggest her to anyone who wants to succeed in Math 1130,3.0,NA
"Seems to understand what he is doing, but is easily the worst teacher I\'ve had at communicating what he is talking about to students. His lack of proficiency in English can be a challenge at times, although accent is clear. Can be incredibly rude at times, calling out students for not knowing answers.",3.7,"understanding, worst teacher, communicating, lack of proficiency, challenge, accent, rude, calling out students"
He really gets down to buisness. Class always got out a few minutes early and he always got everything in. Hes very helpful if you need help just go to him. The only thing that can be a downside is he went very fast. But if you ever missed something in the notes he was willing to give it to you after. Take all the notes and you have no problems,3.6,"efficient, helpful, fast-paced, accommodating"

"Prof. Strong really cares about you. Yes, his tests are difficult but coming from a former professor from UT Health, what do you expect? He trains you for nursing school because keep in mind, nursing school is not easy. I recommend taking him if you can accept the challenge because in the long run, you will learn an awful amount.",3.5,"caring, challenging, experienced, recommended"
"A nice little guy. He wrote the book, so he knows what he\'s talking about. But he WILL put you to sleep. You have no choice though, because he\'s the only one who teaches this class.

He\'s such a nice man. His class is fun!",4.8,"awesome, funny, helpful, caring, easy, nice, fun"
"Jerry is a very nice guy outside of class, but two or three times he singled out students during lecture seemingly for the sole purpose of assuming they had made a stupid mistake, for the sake of discussion.

"Great professor but something you should know right off the bat is that tests arent multiple choice. Theyre matching, true and false, and a type of fill in the blank.

Ebert is a great teacher. Hard to pay attention to the lectures sometimes but he grades on a curve and offers extra credit. I missed the final day and didn\'t even call him till two days after.

"Professor Zacate is the type of professor where her instructions are pretty vague, so you need to make sure to ask as many questions as you need to, to get things cleared up. She gives out a lot of writing assignments which work towards the ten paged paper at the end of the semester for extra credit. She also doesn\'t explain the chapters often.",2.7,"vague instructions, writing assignments, extra credit, lacks explanation"
"Jay is a straight forward professor. He teaches for concepts not for memorization, which is helpful. He is funny and occasionally takes the day to just talk politics with his class and get to know students. There are frequent quizzes but they cover literally exactly what he taught in class. Exams are predictable if you go to class and do the work.",3.5,"straightforward, concepts, helpful, funny, politics, quizzes, predictable"
Abbas is hilarious!!!,4.0,"funny, engaging"
Knows her**** but is really hard. Unfair grader and tests are horrible.,3.5,"knowledgeable, hard, unfair, horrible"
"She\'s really vague and very flaky. However, keep this woman in mind when needing recommendations or someone with a degree to back your opinion. She rocks, in that way. In all, she\'s one of those really accomplished people who has trouble communicating with her classes.",3.2,"vague, flaky, accomplished, trouble communicating"

"Dr. Critelli is an absolutely amazing professor! He makes you critically thinking and challenge yourself beyond your expectation at every class meeting but its is very well worth it! Take goood notes, for your notes are your study guide. He is extremely helpful and if you\'re completely stuck he allows you to call him.He is by far the best professor",4.6,"amazing, challenging, helpful, best"

"Anybody who does not think Prof. Senchack is one of the best teachers ever is sorely mistaken, and likely lazy. People who feel embarrassed only do so because they do not properly prepare for class. the few who actually put in effort are rewarded with one of the most rewarding experiences learning in the field of finance",3.2,"best teacher, prepared, effort, rewarding, finance"
"While he is the very image of the aloof professor, he is fantastic, guiding students through highly dense materially and demanding as much of himself as his students. Probably the hardest course I have taken on a day-to-day basis, but also one of the most rewarding.",3.7,"aloof, fantastic, guiding, demanding, rewarding"
"He is trash. I had 3 tests and 2 lab practicals and each test and practical was completely different than the last making it almost impossible to know how to study. The 2 lab practicals in particular were a complete 180 from each other we basically guaranteed me to fail. He is mean, uncaring, and he likes to make rules to hurt you.",2.8,"trash, impossible, mean, uncaring, hurtful"
"Because she isn\'t a native English speaker, she can be confusing when she is lecturing; she mixes up the definitions of words... You have to do pointless check up homeworks for every class when, most of the time, she will lecture on that material later on. As I said, pointless. She grades your work not according to the methods but correctness.",3.5,"confusing, mixes up definitions, pointless homework, grades based on correctness"
Mr. Tiefenwerth is a very good professor. His reviews are extremely helpful and very accurate towards the test. He is very fair and is willing to work with anyone. He is understanding and empathetic with students because he is one himself.,4.6,"helpful, accurate, fair, understanding, empathetic"
I took his Psychology 203 class. He is really not such a great teacher. He is fun the class is somewhat enjoyable but he is completely unreasonable. He is absent a lot and is a terrible grader. It took me a little while to understand his system and what would be on the tests. If you dont mind teaching yourself then the class isn\'t that bad.,3.3,"unreasonable, absent, terrible grader, teaching yourself"
Decent professor in class but the best outside if you need help. I\'ve never had a prof try so hard to make sure her students understood the material. Genuinely a really really nice person and truly passionate about teaching,4.1,"Decent, best, helpful, understanding, nice, passionate"
