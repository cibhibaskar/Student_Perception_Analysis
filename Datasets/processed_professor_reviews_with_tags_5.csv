Skips through power point slides in lecturesthen doesn\'\'t go back to them but moves on to other power points. Doesn\'\'t say much towards slides.

"Do not take this man if you have the chance. Avoid at all costs. If you get stuck with him be prepared to lose a third of your project grades based on his opinion of your design.

However, he is mostly unhelpful and curt.",2.9,"Avoid at all costs, opinionated, unhelpful, curt"
"He\'s so sweet, I had to study more than for my other classes but I do not regret it at all. Always be present for class, miss more than two classes and you\'re out- no joke.

"I see most other students were just as unhappy with this instructor as I was.

"I took Television History and Form with Professor Murray this semester. She is a good professor, very clear. A bit boring at times but overall a good class.

"I took Studies in Writing as a required course for English Ed, but this is a creative writing course. Wrote 3 creative papers, which I had never done before.

"I loved my honors seminar class with him-- the material we read was very interesting. We had to read a lot and were writing papers every week. It\'s a lot of work, but the knowledge you gain is incredible. Really makes you think. Of course, sometimes he\'ll tell you a bit TMI, but he really tries to connect with his class. You read long novels.",3.6,"knowledgeable, engaging, challenging, thought-provoking, TMI, connecting"
Worst class I have taken at BU. Professor not engaging and tests were not relevant to exams. Most test questions were insignificant facts etc. Sitting through the 80 minute class is extremely boring. Hardly worth attending since the lectures barely reflect the tests. Very disappointing.,2.7,"boring, not engaging, irrelevant tests, disappointing"
"Mr. Carter is a great teacher!! If you need to take this class, this is the teacher. He is extremely nice and very helpful.",4.8,"great teacher, nice, helpful"
"I will be honest, I am horrible at math. She teaches half lecture and the rest online. You must get them right or you won\'t receive credit. Have a question regarding the homework? She only has limited hours so expect to have a question or two only, because that\'s all you\'ll have time for. Get ready for a ton of homework. Tough.",4.4,"tough, limited hours, strict, challenging, online lectures"
I regretted taken class with him. He is just horrible. It is very hard to apply what he taught in class on exams. He\'s not a fair grader. Coming to his class does not worth with bcos you can not apply what he teaches in class on exams and home work. I will never advise anyone to take his class. He will mess up your gpa. His labs grading are worst.,3.8,"horrible, hard to apply, not fair grader, not worth it, mess up, worst"
could be a very interesting class but its not at all. sooo boring. he stutters a lot and doesnt give good feedback to students comments and questions in class,4.0,"boring, stutters, unhelpful, NA"
I skipped almost every Friday and still made an A in his class. Not the best teacher but if you decide to put in the work its an easy class. All you need to do is go over his powerpoints and do the suggested problems.,2.1,NA
"INSANELY HARD PROFESSOR! I tried to meet with her about certain aspects of my grade, and she seemed extremely hard to get in contact with, as well as unresponsive to emails and inquiries. I would NOT recommend her if you care about your grades at all.",3.9,"strict, unresponsive, hard to contact, not recommended"

"It was VERY difficult to earn a good grade. She will write on the board notes that are verbatim to the book and won\'t explain it well at all (if she can, she sometimes refers to students for answers). The programs had me sitting in tutoring for hours on end. The review guides given are decent but very vague, overall avoid this prof if possible.",2.5,"difficult, verbatim, vague, avoid"
I\'ve never had so much fun learning english as with this wonderful funny smart and HOT teacher.,4.4,"funny, smart, HOT"
"Ugh, he apparently graded himself 5 times on this because he is not wonderful. His tests have 20 questions on it, so you can imagine its 5pts each question. You can retake, but if its hard the first time dont expect much the next times. Overall dont expect leniancy its just an illusion, if u messed up on the test its over for you.",4.3,"grader, not wonderful, tests, 20 questions, retake, hard, leniency, illusion, messed up, NA"
"These pre-nursing classes were the reason I decided nursing was not for me. Your grade is dependent almost entirely on 2 exams and a final. The tests are ridiculous with definitions and random questions over APA format and god knows what. She walks around, and stands over you while you test. She is the only option, but I would not recommend.",2.8,"strict, intimidating, unhelpful, not recommended"
A very intelligent man within his field of study. Not the best lecturer. He seems somewhat out of touch with the modern university system. He has an amusing tendency to glorify himself within his lectures.,3.8,"intelligent, out of touch, amusing, glorify"
"She knows writing, but not how to teach it. I think her new personal life is getting in the way of her job and she is not able to successfully teach her class. Everyone I\'ve talked to about it hates/hated her class because her grading is ridiculous and she is sometimes unorganized and unprepared. She loses some of your assignments as well--no mercy",2.9,"unorganized, unprepared, ridiculous grading, loses assignments, NA"
"Most unorganized teacher I have ever had. She is a very sweet woman who will work with you depending on what you have going on in your life, but she assigns more homework than she can even grade. Thanksgiving break is next week and I have not gotten one grade back all year. All of the homework is tedious, and you basically teach yourself.",2.7,"unorganized, sweet, assigns more homework, tedious, self-teaching"
The initial meeting of her was deceitful. She\'s very liberal and vocal about it (in which I\'m opposite). I thought I would hate the class but loved it. She\'s very passionate about what she does and it shows. She will open your mind for sure. It\'s a great class to take because she truly is brilliant on this topic.,3.6,"deceitful, liberal, vocal, passionate, open-minded, brilliant"

Just read the powerpoint. So boring.,2.8,NA
Super super easy class!!! There is hardly any homework in this class. Basically what you don\'t finish in class is your homework. She makes the assignments pretty short and easy. She doesn\'t grade hard at all. Just show up and do the assignments and group work (worth 20 points but super easy) then you will pass easily!,4.4,"easy, short assignments, easy grading, group work"

Worst CIS teacher ever... Seriously he needs to retire or something. He seems like a pretty decent guy but what he teaches is completely irrelevant to what he gives out in his exams. Trust me just take another teacher and get a better grade.,3.3,"worst, needs to retire, irrelevant, exams, better grade"
"She deffinately has her favorites and makes that clear. I\'ve seen people do terrible on speeches and still get better grades then me, just depends on what mood shes in.

Dr. Perkins is the best professor I have had at ACU. I am currently a MAcc student and he still goes back and reviews the basics with us.

"This is honestly the worst prof I\'ve taken in university by far. The world\'s laziest and irresponsible prof award goes to her.

AVOID THIS PROF FOR YOUR GPA\'S SAKE!!!!",3.3,"worst, lazy, irresponsible, inconsistent, avoid"
"You have to work really hard in order to be successful in this class. By the way, she gives many paragraphs and stories to read each class. After that, you have to provide a response of the story.

"I took this class online. It consisted of weekly forums, a few tests, and one paper. I liked that the forum questions were easy to discuss and based on your own personal opinions/experiences.

She was hard to understand. If you asked a question she wouldnt answer it. I almost failed her class because i was so unsure of what to do.

Regardless you leave early.",3.6,"stress free, easy A, no textbook, easy final, take home final, no mid term, leaves early, do homework in lab, do homework in class"
"I have to admit Ellen\'s class is not the easiest but its only because she wants to make sure you get the material. For example, I got a bad grade on our last test BUT I was able to make up the grade by making an appointment with her and ""teaching"" her how to do the ones I got wrong. She is ALWAYS available for extra help.",3.0,"dedicated, challenging, supportive, available"
"Tests are almost impossible, her grading is extreme, and so hard to understand. Avoid at all costs!",3.9,"difficult, extreme, hard to understand, avoid"
Dr Ndon is an excellent teacher. His concern and natural interest for this subject is displayed by his teaching methods. I took this class the first time they offered it and I would recommend it to anyone else that is interested engineering for the environment. His tests and grading is extrememely fair. I would definetly recommend it.,3.2,"excellent teacher, concern, natural interest, teaching methods, recommend, fair grading"

"Prof Lian is amazing. He is incredibly funny and is so passionated about what he is teaching. Everybody knows this guy is good guy, but don\'t let this fool you when it comes to grades. He can be hard. Take a class with him if you are interested in learning something, because believe me, you will. Great class. I enjoyed it.",4.3,"passionate, funny, knowledgeable, challenging"
