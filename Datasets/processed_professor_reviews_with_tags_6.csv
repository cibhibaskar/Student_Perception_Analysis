"Professor Fogel is simply the greatest. He is so incredibly knowledgeable, but not intimidating at all.

"class is more like a book club, class was huge (about 100+ people). he\'ll call you out for talking or leaving early so dont do it (he\'ll actually stop class until you contribute). you learn a lot from the cultural events you attend. its hard to get into the grove of writing 2-4 pages a week in blogs because he wants them done a VERY CERTAIN WAY",3.6,"book club, huge class, calls out, contributes, cultural events, writing difficulty, very certain way"
"Tom is the greatest of all time. The number 1 teacher I\'ve ever had. A bit out of the norm but, ask him what the norm is and he\'ll tell you it\'s all about the chairness!

"If you have a full time job, and are taking three classes, do not take her class.

She barely responds to emails& You will not know your grade until the report after the final. Do not take this class!!",3.4,"unresponsive, overwhelming workload, delayed feedback, discouraging"

Same as all of the other comments do NOT make her mad!",4.0,"favorite, makes you think, different perspective, opinionated, not afraid, mad"
"She\'s a very nice and pleasant woman and easy to talk to. Her class can get a little boring at times (too many group presentations, it gets old fast) and there\'s daily homework assignments, but the subject was actually pretty interesting.

his teaching style is super cool. he is very warm and kind man.,4.4,"cool, warm, kind"

morna knows what she is talking about and has alot of knowledge in the design industry. She may not be as forceful as other teachers but she still helps out if you ever need it and will work with you outside of class which alot of other teachers don\'t do. I would recomend her for design 1or 2!!,2.3,"knowledgeable, helpful, accommodating, recommended"

"DO NOT TAKE.I switched into her class and not only is she a hardcore feminist that only gives women a chance, she is a really tough grader. She also doesn\'t care about her students (again, unless you\'re a woman passionate about feminism). Do NOT take her. She will have you rolling your eyes as she complains about male privilege.",3.3,"hardcore feminist, tough grader, doesn't care about students, complains about male privilege"

"This lady is crazy! I took her for calc 3 expecting it to be not as bad and boy was I wrong!

I miss Dr. Nina so much. I am so honored to have sung under her.,4.0,"honored, sung under, miss"
She was a very fair teacher. Don\'t expect her class to be super easy just because she is pretty. Don\'t expect to do well if you don\'t read/don\'t retain what you\'ve read. She is very specific about what will be on the tests/ papers and is very easy to talk to if you\'re confused. No reason why you shouldn\'t do well if you put forth effort.,4.3,"fair, specific, easy to talk to, effort"

"A sweetheart and great professor. I wish he taught more classes for I\'d register for them all. Definitely take this class for its a fun and memorable experience.

Amazing professor. My favorite professor at BA and main campus. Super friendly and extremely encouraging. Easy A. Uses real life experiences in her discussions.

This is the worst class I\'ve ever taken at Cornell. Hirschl hates economics as a science(and consequently economics majors like myself) and is the most boring lecturer ever. Even the books he chose were biased.

"I\'ll take two posts to describe this guy: he\'s got nothing but rocks on the brain, that\'s for sure.

Okay so i am going to start with the good things because this professor isn\'t a terrible person just really tough. She stops for questions students have. Her grading is really tough though. On tests she deducts many points for small mistakes even for handwriting. If math isn\'t your thing its going to be tough. Homework is worth almost nothing.,2.4,"tough, stops for questions, grading strict, deducts points for small mistakes, tough on handwriting, homework worth almost nothing"
"If you know a little hebrew than you wont have a problam. If you dont know anything its not terribly hard, but youll have to work. Overall he is a very nice guy.

"Worst prof I have had in my 5 years in college. He is hateful, mean & rude. It is apparent that he is a man who is unhappy in his life & will take his power of being a professor & use it against his students. He tries to make things as hard as he can.

Don\'t expect an easy class; this is college.",4.7,"passionate, knowledgeable, engaging, challenging"
"BG I owned you!!! If you do not like this class you are not an academic, drop out now! I have never laughed so much in a class in my life, he\'s so funny.

"Don\'t take symmetry. Most pointless and confusing class I\'ve ever taken. She\'s not a bad professor but the subject is just very confusing and abstract. It was a very awkward class.

"Dr. Bakker\'s class was very difficult and not to be taken lightly. During class he tries to be funny, but often goes over as rude and demeaning.

I wouldn\'t recommend taking him.",2.3,"difficult, rude, demeaning, not explained, brilliant, not good at teaching, not recommend"

Probably the worst professor I\'ve had in my college career so far! Doesn\'t keep track of grades and won\'t let you know until last minute if you are missing anything.

I would NOT suggest him.,2.9,"worst, doesn't keep track of grades, last minute, missing assignments, changed grade, paper was late"

Loved this Prof! He was one of the best prof\'s I have ever had!,4.2,"Loved, best"
"This class was absolutely horrible. Took her over the summer as a hybrid class. No one could ever get ahold of her...not even our lab teacher. When the tests were actually graded, they were graded by her assistant and graded incorrectly. Im still waiting on my final grade to be posted..which was due yesterday by noon.",2.9,"horrible, unresponsive, unorganized, incorrect grading, delayed grading"
"He was tough, but interesting.",3.5,"tough, interesting"
Dr. Harris is the most intelligent individual I\'ve had the privilege of being in class with. I learned more in Com 450 and Com 225 than any other class. He is extremely friendly and extremely interesting. I enjoyed going to class!,4.3,"intelligent, friendly, interesting, enjoyed attending class"

It\'s a lit class so there is obviously a lot of reading. Dr. Lape does a great job of explaining things. She is very easy to get along with. Participation in discussion is required but she welcomes all thoughts and does not put anybody down. She is also funny which makes literature not so boring. Would take another class by her again.,4.5,"approachable, knowledgeable, engaging, encouraging, humorous"
"Does not teach very well, and hard to understand at times.",1.8,"#unhelpful, #hard-to-understand"
"He is one of the best teachers I had in this community college. Although he is hard, he is the fairest grader I have ever met. If you want to learn how to think critically you should take this class. He is very serious and isn\'t afraid to tackle very critical logical misconceptions. But if you want an easy A this isn\'t the class for you.",3.5,"best, hard, fair, critical thinking, serious, logical, misconceptions"
This teacher is very difficult. She confused me with the assignments. I like history a lot and she made me dislike it a lot in her class.,1.9,"difficult, confused, dislike"
"lectures are boring, but you can still get an A if you sleep through them... but at times he is very interesting and funny",4.0,"boring, interesting, funny"
