"He is a nice enough man, he knows his stuff well. He isn\'t very interesting or very structured, but he does teach the class as a college course should be taught. No points given except for tests and quizzes, but he does curve, quite a bit I might say. I liked him, as a person, but never again as a prof.",3.9,"knowledgeable, structured, fair, curves grades, liked as a person",0.6249,positive,Jans Wager,"knowledgeable, structured, fair, liked as a person, curves grades",knowledgeable,structured,fair,liked as a person,curves grades

"Teacher was so focused on getting assignments completed that she ignored the needs of the students creating a negative learning environment. She often would not allow breaks, would teach during lunch, , and assigned more homework then possible, leaving students tired and stressed.

"Although he does get a bit incomprehensible at times, he is a pretty good math teacher.

"Economics is a tough field for me, and I really struggled in this class. I met with him during office hours and he wasn\'t able to offer me any advice. I spent $200 on a tutor and I still didn\'t do well -- I got a C+ which I consider bad for the amount of work I put into the class. He also made a mistake and recorded my grade as an F, and I had to go through tons of paperwork to get it changed.

He\'s a great teacher with a dad type sense of humor even though he\'s pretty young. His teaching skips around a bit during lecture but he makes it interesting enough that you can pretty much keep up. If you get lost he\'s quick to guide you back on track. Attendance is a biggie with him and could be the difference of an B or A in his class.,3.9,"great teacher, dad sense of humor, young, skips around, interesting, keeps up, quick to guide, attendance important, B or A difference",0.8658,positive,Jans Wager,"interesting, young, skips around, quick to guide, keeps up",interesting,young,skips around,quick to guide,keeps up
"Funny guy, he really knows his stuff. If you read the textbook, you will be fine for the tests. Make flash cards and do the essays before hand and see him during office hours - he will give you answers and help for the tests.

He is very nice and wants to help if you go to him for help. Read the material before class to actually understand what he is saying.

Mrs. Jackson is a character and she expects you to work hard. She explains her material clearly and gives a lot of hand outs. I would recommend her to someone who has been out of school for a while. You should pass her class with a B or better.. She is not a hard teacher and do not get on her bad side!!!!!!!!!!,3.5,"character, expects you to work hard, explains material clearly, gives hand outs, recommend, not hard teacher, do not get on her bad side",0.4767,positive,Robert Warden,"recommend, character, not hard teacher, gives hand outs, explains material clearly",recommend,character,not hard teacher,gives hand outs,explains material clearly
