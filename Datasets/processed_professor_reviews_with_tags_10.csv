"Tests: extremely difficult, unless you actually memorize each of the 80 definitions she hands out for you to look up. The tests also have little to do with class discussions. Homework: read 100 pages a week. Her attitude: standoffish, does NOT understand this is a gen. ed. i\'m a studio art major, which means more time consuming work than most oth",3.4,"difficult, memorize, definitions, little to do with class discussions, standoffish, gen ed, studio art major, time consuming work"

Great professor. He is ALWAYS willing to help no matter what. He is definitely one of the best English professors that TCC has to offer.,3.7,"Great, ALWAYS willing to help, best English professor"
"One of the better teachers in the school. Very willing to help and can explain things in different ways. Large amount of busy work, but tests are basically given from past tests which he posts. Also very funny and acts like just one of the guys.",3.8,"helpful, explain well, funny, approachable"
"Johnston is the sort of teacher that probably should have retired twenty years ago. His classes are great if you want to listen to him complain about his personal life for an hour and a half, but if you actually want to learn something, you better find another teacher. He doesn\'t have clear grades and isn\'t very articulate either.",3.9,"retired, complain, personal life, learn, clear grades, articulate"
"Excellent lecturer, gets you engaged and makes sure you leave class having learned something. Attendance is mandatory but you don\'t have to participate. Unfortunately, she has ridiculously difficult exams and a luck-based bonus system, which drags down your GPA. Other professors for the same course will have easier exams.",3.8,"Excellent lecturer, engaging, makes you learn, mandatory attendance, difficult exams, luck-based bonus system, drags down GPA, easier exams by other professors

Easy A, take him.",4.6,"funny, knowledgeable, engaging, hints, easy A"
"incredible professor! funny, sweet, and interesting. i admired him so much we were friends outside of the classroom. he doesn\'t belittle students, but he demands attention. it\'s about respect. he needs to do his job, you need to earn your grade with knowledge. my favorite professor in my 6 years of college. would love to get in contact w/ him again",4.9,"funny, sweet, interesting, admired, friends, respect, demands attention, favorite professor"

"I was in Dr. Hall\'s class for two semesters of Excursions. Got into a lot of subject matter you wouldn\'t classify as ""math."" Wouldn\'t call it easy, but wouldn\'t call it hard either.

"Mitra is very smart. With that said however, he\'s not very good at teaching. Expect to furiously write the examples HE solves on the board, leaving the class confused, and teaching yourself. There\'s no HW and there are 3 exams plus a final. He does drop the lowest grade of one of the regular exams.

"Online classes have always been tricky, and intro to lit is no exception. I accidentally sighed up for the 8 week class and with 5 other classes--it was brutal.

So it can sometimes feel like your lost and unsure how to improve your work.",3.7,"tricky, brutal, workload, lost, unsure, NA"

A useful course for those who are preparing to find a spot in the marketplace.Students learn to navigate through real world current & relevant scenarios.The course gets a boost with the inclusion of periodic lectures & talks with industry gurus.With so much happening in the cyberspace the course couldn\'t have been introduced at a better time,4.6,"useful, preparing, marketplace, navigate, real world, relevant, boost, periodic lectures, talks, industry gurus, cyberspace, introduced at a better time"
Dr. Hill is one of the best and most passionate MIS teachers. all the people who don\'t like him should honestly consider changing their major.

"He\'s really into books. A little eccentric, but a great professor. He\'s all about the deeper meaning in books so be ready to actually do the reading - cliff and spark notes won\'t help you in his class. He\'s a tough grader - especially on essays, but take solace in the fact that he lets you know what he wants so it shouldn\'t be a surprise.",3.8,"knowledgeable, eccentric, great professor, deep meaning, tough grader, clear expectations"
"Dr. Asplin is really knowledgeable and is good at explaining tough material. She is a great resource of information for psych students especially.

"Professor Chung is a great teacher! Sometimes, he copies and pastes HW questions directly from the textbook onto the exams, and he usually tells the class beforehand what kind of questions there\'ll be.

"For a class with Freshman non-English majors, the class was rough. He expects a lot from his students, and you have to work to improve your grade.

The lectures are pretty mediocre and there\'s a heavy workload for a 3 credit hour class. Your final grade is basically how much time you spent outside of class so it\'s 100% possible to get an A if you\'re willing to put in the time. If you\'re not a history buff and just looking to get a gen ed requirement I suggest you look elsewhere,3.1,"mediocre, heavy workload, time-consuming, possible to get an A with effort, not recommended for non-history buffs"

"Professor Reed has clear, well constructed lectures that specifically prepare you for the exams. This is NOT a memorize and pass class.

I took lecture online and lab on campus. Lecture test are not the easiest alot of fill in the blanks. Lab was super easy. I like Mr. Mann and I will take him again.

"Definitely one of the worst teachers I\'ve had here. She repeats herself and talks about herself the whole lecture.

"Professor Woody explains concepts in more than one way so everyone can understand. She is enthusiastic about the subject, which makes lectures engaging.

Hes alright but the hype is really unjustified. His rating should be around 3.0. Lectures are out of the book and homework problems are obviously way different than the generic book examples.

The 2 exam format seems to be a trend of history profs. The fact that he doesn\'t require you to talk is a bonus since you then get participation points for free.

The whole class was taught off the internet. Count on this guy to bore you to death AND! give you papers that will take you days. The only sources for your papers are primary documents which were written hundreds of years ago and are hard to understand.,3.7,"boring, unengaging, challenging, difficult, traditional"

"He\'s a little man with a gigantic ego. Loves to hear himself talk. Definitely knows his stuff, but a poor teacher. Very poor.",3.4,"arrogant, knowledgeable, poor teacher"
"Professor Sharif is not the professor to take dynamics with. We spend class going over future homework examples. While this may seem nice, our homework did not relate to the first exam. Also, when a student asks him a question in class he simply repeats what he has said before which is not helpful. I would not recommend him for dynamics.",2.9,"unhelpful, repetitive, not recommended, disconnected, irrelevant"
very ignorant and arrogant...made my life miserable!!!,2.6,"ignorant, arrogant, miserable"
I took Prof. Fenton for Math 1410 and I struggle with math. She is very sweet but she is very confusing when she tries to teach.

"The way that he teaches really does not help the students at all. The only thing that he did was make a power point of the chapter in the book, then read it off the screen.

I could have learned as much by only looking at the book",2.9,"boring, unhelpful, unengaging, uninteractive"

"He makes statistics very understandable. The course does not have as much math as I feared, I suck at math and this class was my favorite. 8 hws which you need at least an hour for, weekly quizzes worth ~2% each 2 exams and a final.

I liked the way she taught we got written and oral credit. It was a lot of worl but it was all well worth it.,3.9,"liked, taught, written and oral credit, worth it"
Good professor. Had a lot of group work. That is all the class is. You need to teach yourself because he will not lecture. He will emphisise main points in your PowerPoint presentations.

Labs were fun and easy credit.,3.3,"Good, group work, teach yourself, emphasize main points, crazy curve, participation is a must, WebCT, fun labs, easy credit"

Great professor! Very enthusiastic and cares about her students. She is so genuine and nice. I hate history so this class was boring for me but very easy. Her tests are easy if you go to the review.

Overall great woman :),4.2,"enthusiastic, cares about students, genuine, nice, easy tests, test review, informative, fair grading"

Very knowledgable! I learned more from her in one semester than I learned in a couple of years in high school.,4.6,"knowledgeable, learned, impressive"
"I have to comment about his pipe collection as well, he is the man that lives in a pipe. Other than that, don\'t take him if you want a professor to actually teach you. A typical class starts with him complaining about how poorly his stocks are doing, and then he might call roll, followed by a quick scan of the chapter and maybe he\'ll draw a picture",3.6,"complaining, unengaging, disorganized, distracted, unhelpful"
"Great teacher, motivator, talker, advice giver, just all around greatness. I had her for all of my sports modules and I enjoyed every single minute and every single class.

"Lectures are good but quizzes aren\'t based on them. Gives A LOT of work and assigns 70 pgs to read for every 2 days. When I took his class I was taking four others. THANK GOD my other classes didn\'t have a big load of homework like he did. For the Exams he tells you that its covers things that are on the outline, which is basically everything.",4.2,"strict, heavy workload, excessive reading, comprehensive exams"
Professor was very knowledgeable in the field. Does good reviews for tests. No attendance policy. Just print out slides and study. Pulls questions for the test out of slides.

"Professor Patierno is very nice and easy to understand. Class is very easy & not a lot of work.

Overall a great guy!!",3.5,"cute, sweet, jokes, confusing, quizzes, essays, great"
Don\'t ever choose this professor for any course. I took him for a Hunger class and he absolutely hated me for no reason. He\'s very rude and arrogant.
