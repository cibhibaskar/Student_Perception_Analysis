"Im TERRIFIED of public speaking and after this class i cannot say I am less so, but Mr.B is a caring prof who really wants you to do well! The comments saying to just try aren\'t wrong, he\'s an easy grader and I should have gotten a B cause of my exam scores but ended up with an A anyways? Also happened to a friend of mine.

"I learned a lot in this class. Honestly, if you\'re a pre-med, you need this class. He teaches on the med school level. He is hard, but if you put in work you WILL make an A.

Go to everything, make you get to know him, and you\'ll live.",3.1,"dedicated, high expectations, supportive, helpful, engaging"

"Professor Milburn\'s lectures can at times be dry (due to his sometimes monotone voice), but if you are interested in psychology, there is no way to make this subject boring. His exams are easy, IF you do the online quizzes, which have all the answers in them. Most of the class got C\'s, but that\' due to poor work ethic, he provides the way to an A!",3.2,"dry, monotone, easy exams, online quizzes, poor work ethic, A opportunity"

"Prof. Curtis is one of the my favorite professors I have taken thus far. I took his class 8:15 in the morning, but it was the best. He is very wise.

Rebecca Comay is eloquent and brilliant. Her instruction in the Hegel course got me far beyond my expectation. The bitterness towards her coherence must be from some combination of a reluctance to read and a small vocabulary.,3.3,"eloquent, brilliant, instruction, Hegel course, expectation, bitterness, coherence, reluctance, read, small vocabulary"

He is very smart and loves BLUF, Bottom Line Up Front, and will tell you exactly what he wants for each assignment.",4.1,"smart, demanding, improves, direct"
GREAT!!! I took his class over the summer at Moorpark college and kept up with him just fine. He gives real-life applications of the material throughout his lectures & exams. Has a traditional teaching style & provides book problems for help; I did better only going off his notes. Write your notes neat enough to follow along when you REWRITE them!,4.2,"GREAT, real-life applications, traditional teaching style, provides book problems, neat notes, REWRITE"

"I\'m currently in this class and it sucks. Its friggin health class so it should be easy, and I shouldn\'t have to try gah dammit!anyway... I studied for the last test and didn\'t do so well, even with a study guide. It\'d be more helpful to know exactly what\'s on the test. Wellness project is easy tho.",4.1,"difficult, unhelpful, frustrating, easy"
This guy is very interesting. His lectures aren\'t really helpful when it comes to the tests. With that said he gives a lot of extra points during class so showing up is a good idea. If you read the book it\'s an easy A. He does have a tendency to drone on about himself but the stories are pretty funny (and almost unbelievable).,4.3,"interesting, not helpful, extra points, easy A, tendency to drone on, funny, unbelievable"

Professor Raj is an all around good professor. He is clear and you will understand the material. His tests are not easy but they are not overly difficult if you pay attention. I would recommend him for DBC.,2.4,"clear, understanding, recommend, good"
Talks very quietly and drones but what he\'s saying is easy to understand. Which is good for me since I suck at econ.

Very nice to students so long as you are nice back.,3.4,"quiet, easy to understand, patient, explains well, nice to students"
"Todd is the best professor i\'ve ever had (like many other students here). I honestly believe he is a complete genius.

"Dr. Dunn is an AMAZING professor! She wont give you the class on a silver platter, but when all is said and done you will be very grateful.

Apparently for a beginning classical guitar class you must have been playing and know to read music. I took it for winter intersession for an intro guitar course but from day one he already has the intention of weeding out those who can\'t play.

This professor gave wayyyy too many assignments. We had several repetitious assignments within the first week. I do not like the way he organizes his work on blackboard. He is just a confusing professor overall. I would not recommend taking him........,3.4,"assignments, repetitious, organizes, confusing, not recommend"
"Tough class I will have to say. Professor is very vague, and all of the studying is up to you....no hints at all as to what will be covered.

"Class structure is great honestly; just do the online homework, exams, and papers. If you try to speak with her outside of office ours (even if it\'s before or after class) she won\'t talk to you and is quite rude about it. Feedback through e-mails are short and obviously rude. Lectures and PowerPoints are very non-specific and all over the place.",4.2,"great class structure, online homework, exams, papers, rude, short feedback, non-specific lectures, disorganized PowerPoints"
BEST PROFESSOR EVER! she genuinely cares about giving you an education instead of just helping you simply pass the class. She is funny when necessary and is all around such a great human being.

Mr. Shirani is one of the few teachers that gives out very helpful study guides so you know what to study for on the mid/final. 4-5 Homeworks assignments throughout the sem. no group projects.

Prof. Spears is by far the BEST professor/instructor/teacher I have had in my entire University experience.

Honestly he\'s a great professor. He\'s not bad at all. All you have to do is show up to his class and listen. What he teaches in class is whats gonna be on the test. study his notes and read the sections he assigns in the book! i got an 84 on the first test and a 96 on the second. havent taken the final yet.

His lectures make no sense but you never have to show up to class. He only gives a midterm and final and as long as you get the review he gives out the class before youll do fine. He uses the same exact questions on the midterm and final as the review with different numbers. he leaves the room during the test and the class takes the test together,3.4,NA

This is by far the worst instructor I have ever had. She takes for ever to grade assignments but yet she never takes the time to correct her typos. It\'s like she leaves them on purpose.

"Whether or not you like him will depend on your style. Dr. B gives a lot of hw and tests frequently.

"It\'s difficult for me to rate him accurately because I already knew everything covered in CS 100 so I found the class pretty boring.

very knowledgeable. hw from the textbook doesnt really help with preparing for tests. getting the solutions manual will really help (several of our problems couldnt be solved or had errors in the solution). he made a lot of mistakes working problems in class which made it easy to get confused. his multiple choice are pretty tough. Overall great guy,4.5,"knowledgeable, solutions manual, mistakes, confused, tough"
"Final grade may be 50% participation but speaking in class is really not required. I spoke about 4 times, got A\'s on papers and got an A- in the course.

If you don\'t mind reading, take her!",3.3,"approachable, understanding, lenient, fair, paper-focused"
"Great teacher. It\'s a fun subject and she is organized and clear about what she requires. The midterm and final are extremely straightforward (just do the readings at some point).

Favorite teacher at Moorpark so far!",4.8,"nice, clear, fair, lecture-based, favorite"
I had her for newswriting and she is very unclear and tests are over too much information to even study for. Most assignments seem unplanned and on the spot most days.

Brooks is not a good professor. He lectures very heavy and if you don\'t pay attention you won\'t pass.
